/*
Write a function called "computeSumBetween".

Given 2 integers, "computeSumBetween" returns the sum between the two given integers, beinning at num1, and excluding num2.

Notes:
* The sum between 1 and 4 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
* If num2 is not greater than num1, it should return 0.

var output = computeSumBetween(2, 5);
console.log(output); // --> 9
*/

function computeSumBetween(num1, num2) {
    // code here
}

console.log(computeSumBetween(1, 4));
console.log(computeSumBetween(2, 5));
